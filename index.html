        <div class="det">
          This story is based on the bond/relation of two people. Let the boy name be "CM/myself" and the
           girl's name be "M". Moving towards. The story starts on march of 2020. My family shifted to a
           new place where two buildings are just connected to each other(she lives in the first building
           and me in the 2nd). When i first went to new house  their something miracle happens  someone
           come to greetings my parents and she also come near me to greetings, where we first meet  but
           couldn't see each others face. Then she moved to her college and after some time I also went
           to college, then Lockdown started. I came home and got connected to everyone inside the boundary
           like uncle , aunty, all of her sisters. Then she comes home after 2-3 days, as soon as she reached
           here everyone just uttered my name in front of her, for which she was angry for the first time without
           knowing me or seeing me. After some days she just teases me on "CHIRKUTT" in front of my sister, after
           hearing this I also named her "BUDHII" . It runs for 1-2 days. Next on 10th April we first talk on
           instagram. We just randomly talked there and then we shifted to Whatsapp on 22nd April. We talked over
           day and night and for the first time charted upto 5PM on wp and it's all about our past.  After that the
           day went well. We talked so much and shared a lot of things. //This feeling is new for her and for me it
           started like something new//,and something interesting is that I never talk to her on phone or face to face
           because I am frightened of her whenever I see her. Everyone knows that Happy moments or smiling faces can't
           go on for a long time. There was a sad moment waiting for both of us. One day she went to her village and
           uninstall all of her social media platform where we talk, She just want me to talk to her but i thought
           she ignore me or she thought i'm forcing her if I will talk over her or force her to tell me what is
           going in herlife, which was the first mistake by me that i couldn't understand her as much she understand
           me for expecting me something. After that we discuss it and clear all those things. It's my mistake
           because of my past, I couldn't expect that there is someone who trusts and believes in me, somehow 
           I feel very sad for my mistake and it could make me happy that yes there is someone who  genuinely
           needs me in her life. After that 3-4 month went well then how and what are the things that running in
           my mind for which it slowdone to talk her, then i went to BBSR , where i completely slowdone to talk
           with her because of tina, mama and one of my +2 frd , where she thought I'm ignoring her for someone
           else and she finally decided not to talk with me anymore as she want to hell herself as she was before
           talk to me, it will go for 1 month i think and she ignored me and don't talk to me also , I couldn't
           stands on her trust , belief, expectation, feelings on me, its my biggest mistake. Then I realised
           everything and stopped all my stuff and decided to move forward with her till my last breath, And 
           I also decided not to break her trust, belief, expectation, feelings on me. And promise her and myself
           that each and every sec I'm and will be with her,support her and don't make her cry, And will not
           anywhere without her just hold her hand till my last breath. After that i just wait for the right
           time to talk to her then finally the day has come, she need calculator for her semester exam, on
           7th march i went there and give it to her and apologize her for my mistake she still angry on me,
           This is the first time we talk face to face in front of each other. That day and those moments I will
           never forget. That day i also brought 2 kitkat for her where she just wanted 1, i think that 1 kitkat
           she didn't eat till now. Then After 3-4 days she got an exam break, then that night we discussed all
           these things and cleared all, the chart went for 4 AM. After the exam was over I went to her campus with
           2 Ice creams which she denied first. Then we ate and talked till 8PM. Then I came there and reached my
           room and called her immediately and talked for 1 hr or more, it was our first call. Then after 2-3 days
           I again visited there at 6:25 PM with Mango and we sat there and walked inside the campus till 9 PM.
           After that  she went home and came after 3-4 days and called me to give me chicken and mushrooms.
           After that I visit once and we spend some quality time together and eat momos, dahi gupchup and cold drinks.
           It was the last memory that we spent together till now. I missed those days , those fights and missed you also.

   Ate sara life re hela pare kebe bhabinathili emiti kehi jhia milibe boli funi mote, thnk god eta possible
  heithibaru, janichi kebe kebe na kahiba katha kahidauchi jauthiire tame hrt haucha mana dukha karucha  ta pai
  tame jaha kahiba karibi, hele kebe ea sabu pai dureijibani, mora kau bi jinsa re ate patience nahi au 1-2 thara kia

  talking to you. The day starts with you and ends with you.One day you are a stranger to a person who's my favourite,
  happiness and my everything. I always thank God for making me meet you. It's hard to explain how important you are
  to me. You won't believe how important you for me and It's also difficult for me to explain how I feel for you. I
  think it's more than friendship or beyond it.
   
  It's your birthday mankidi MANY MANY HAPPY RETURNS OF THE DAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU sabubele khusi re ruha
  bhala re ruha au pura chill kara mu achi sabubele tama sahita.
  EVERY STORY MAY BE BEST BUT OUR IS MY FAV.

  THANK YOU EVERYTHING THAT YOU GIVE ME.
